## Hi there, I’m Lyssa Henderson

I’m a student majoring in cybersecurity at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I’ve worked as a Teaching Assistant for an introductory Python course, helping students understand programming basics and debug their code. I also have hands-on operational experience from working at Amazon Fulfillment Centers, where I developed a strong attention to detail, efficiency, and teamwork in roles like stowing, picking, packing, and shipping.

I’m currently building skills in network security, ethical hacking, and secure software development, and I’m looking forward to starting my career in the cybersecurity field after graduation in July 2026.
